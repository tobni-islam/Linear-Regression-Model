# Linear-Regression-Model

As a part of my learning process in data science and machine learning, I built this linear regression model from scratch without relying on popular machine learning libraries like Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow. The goal was to understand the underlying concepts and implement a predictive model using fundamental tools.

The project utilizes NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for data visualization. The model predicts health insurance charges based on various input features.
